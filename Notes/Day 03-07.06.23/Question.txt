If the number of calls made is between 100 and 150 then, for the first 100 its the same 200Rs while, for the next 50 calls, each call costs 0.6Rs. So, the formula used is:

totalbill=totalbill+((n-100)*0.6);

Else, if the number of calls (n) is between 150 to 200 then, till 150 calls its the same as above while, for the next 50 calls i.e., 150th to 200th call, it costs 0.5Rs per call. So, the calculation is as follows:

totalbill=totalbill+((n-100)*0.6+(n-150)*0.5);

Else if the number of calls (n) is greater than 200 then, for all the calls after 200th call, it costs 0.4Rs per call. So, the calculation is as follows:





totalbill=200+((n-100)*0.6+(n-150)*0.5+(n-200)*0.4);

Taxable Income	Rate (%)
First $20,000	0
Next $20,000	10
Next $20,000	20
The remaining	30

$85000, the income tax payable is $20000*0% + $20000*10% + $20000*20% + $25000*30%.
